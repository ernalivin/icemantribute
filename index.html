    <h3>A Brief History of just how Iceman became gay!</h3>
    <div id="list">
      <ul>
        <li><span>1963: </span> Stan Lee and Jack Kirby create and introduce Iceman in X-Men #1. He was one of the five original members of the mutant team. Mutants are genetically different, their powers manifesting once they hit puberty. Mutants would become metaphors for the differences in humans that they couldn't help- such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability- and that others would use to fuel their own prejudice and hate.</li>
        <li><span>the rest of the 1960s to the early 90s: </span>TBH, not much really happens with Iceman. He gets an accounting degree, has some ill-fated romances with Cloud and Opal Tanaka, and joins some super-hero teams such as the Champions and X-Factor.</li>
        <li><span>the mid 1990s: </span>Iceman gets his mind possessed by Emma Frost. She is able to use his power in new and better ways. After that incident, Iceman confronts her. And she tells him that she knows the real reason he is holding himself back.</li>
        <li><span>2013: </span> It's already been established at this point that Iceman is an omega-level mutant, meaning that there is potentially no upper limit to his power. For example, in Astonishing X-Men 65, he temporarily becomes evil and lets his powers loose for once, disrupting weather patterns throughout the world.</li>
        <li><span>2015: </span> The teenaged original X-Men, including young Bobby Drake, were brought to the present (don't ask it's too complicated). Young Bobby is in a timeline where he feels comfortable to finally come out as gay. He confronts older Bobby about it, and older Bobby subsequently comes out as well. <span>Finally!</span></li>
      </ul>

        <p>"I put all my energy into being a mutant and an X-Man and putting my life in danger every ten minutes for everyone else. And that's not a brag. I made that choice. And you ask yourself: Can I just have one part of my life that I'm not being persectured for?"</p>
